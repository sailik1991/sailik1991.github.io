Research Aspects:
- [1.2] Beyond adversarial learning in GAN-like fashion, we might land up with GAN-like mode-collapse issues too.
- [2.3] Do we need different LLMs for creative tasks vs. optimization tasks?
- [3.1] Not surprising a [7M model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871) that beats frontier models on reasoning datasets like ARC-AGI-1 & ARG-AGI-2. It may be worse on tasks that expect memory (no results on those datasets).

AI Usability Aspects:
- [1.3] I am super-aligned on this; I feel I use it as a developer improvement tool too.
